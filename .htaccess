# This .htaccess is for shared hosting setup
# 
# IMPORTANT: On Hostinger shared hosting, you have two options:
#
# Option 1 (Recommended): Point your domain's document root to the 'public' folder
#   - In Hostinger hPanel, set document root to: /home/username/getReady/public
#   - This .htaccess file is not needed in this case
#
# Option 2: If you cannot change document root, move all contents from 'public' 
#   folder to 'public_html' and update public_html/index.php paths accordingly
#
# For Option 1, you can delete this file.
# For Option 2, this file helps redirect requests to public folder (if needed)

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    
    # Only redirect if not already in public folder
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
